# Horiseon-HTML-Refactor

First code refactor task as part of the bootcamp consists of making the website more accessible through implementing semantic HTML elements and making the starter code much cleaner than it originally was.

This project is a useful insight into real industry practices and allows me to personally explore the different meanings of what 'accessible' means in the wider technology industry, exteneding into potential design ideas.
