# Horiseon-HTML-Refactor

## Descripion
First code refactor task as part of the bootcamp consists of making the website more accessible through implementing semantic HTML elements and making the starter code much cleaner than it originally was.

This project is a useful insight into real industry practices and allows me to personally explore the different meanings of what 'accessible' means in the wider technology industry, exteneding into potential design ideas.

## Process and Results
The refactor consisted of swapping out numerous < div > elements for more accessible semantic elements, including the linked css file once changes were made in the HTML file, resulting in a better, more readable version of the code which allows easier and more effective changes to the code for the marketing agency in the future, especially useful for website making changes in the future.
